# Bibi Tools

A bot for using osint tools on Discord


### Why ?
It’s always easier to use a tool in ease, that’s why I made this bot!



# How to install Bibi tools ?

Put the tools in /root/tools

```bash
  apt install git
  git clone https://github.com/MasterChad/bibi-tools-osint.git
  cd bibi-tools-osint
  npm i
```


Now you must configurate it, go through the files to see what needs to be changed, I’m lazy to detail everything, you just have to put the right paths.
    
### Important
You can host the bot.
You cannot SELL the bot.
You can modify the bot.
